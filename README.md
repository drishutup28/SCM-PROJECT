Simple Calculator Using Switch Case:
Our Approach:
1. We will do all the following steps inside a never-ending loop so that the calculator program keeps on working.
2. Take input of operator and then operands.
3. Check whether the user wants to quit the program if yes then quit it, for this, we can use a special character and tell the user about it like here we used “x”. 
4.Using switch case check operators and do operations accordingly.
