It solves the problem to manage the record in the hospital about the name of the patient, its diseases, its ID, and its location so that we can easily identify the problem and provide the best solution. In this project, we create the website's backend using the C programming language.
In this project, we are adding one new collaborator (Divya Bhoria). By using this hospital management system, it is very easy to do the work, as managing such big data at one place is very difficult and cannot be done on one system or by one person.
